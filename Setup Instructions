Control machine
  1.) Download all the files from the git repo into the same directory
    a.) Edit inventory.yml so that "ansible_host=100.64.2.55" is replaced with the target windows IP
    b.) Edit inventory.yml so that "ansible_user=Administrator" is replaced with the target windows username
    c.) Edit inventory.yml so that "ansible_password=Administrator" is replaced with the target windows password
    d.) Edit keylogger_playbook.yml so the "username:" and "password:" are correct
    e.) Edit keylogger_playbook.yml so the filepath from where your keylogger.py stored on the control machine is correct
    f.) Edit keylogger_playbook.yml so the filepath for the destination on your windows machine makes sense
    g.) Edit keylogger.py so the "log_file_path" makes sense on your windows machine
  2.) Make sure python is installed
  4.) download ansible

Windows machine
  1.) Download python
  2.) download ansible
  3.) pip install pynput

Running Program
  1.) The only thing you need to do after you edit all the files to your liking is run "sudo ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml
      main_playbook.yml --verbose".
  2.) wait about 15 seconds and a popup should come up on the windows machine. 
  3.) click ok and type away anywhere inside the windows machine. Try to create a phrase that you can later read
  4.) When you are done typing click "esc" on your keyboard to stop the program, another popup should appear.
  5.) wait a little longer (about 1-1.5 minutes) and if you look at the control machine you will see what you typed while the
      program was running!
